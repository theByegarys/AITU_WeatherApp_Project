# Assignment_#2_Weather_App

Welcome to AITU Weather App v1, a user-friendly weather web app powered by Node.js. With just the city name, you can get the latest weather update in a snap.

We've integrated three key APIs—OpenWeather, Flags, and Facts—to provide accurate weather info, display flags for a global touch, and share interesting facts about the queried location.

Built with four essential dependencies—axios, request, ejs, and express—AITU Weather v1 ensures a smooth experience, from server communication to dynamic content rendering.

Enjoy simplicity and accuracy in checking the weather—AITU Weather v1 makes staying informed a breeze. Just type in the city, and the latest weather details are right in front of you!
